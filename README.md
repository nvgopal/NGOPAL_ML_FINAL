Machine Learning and Predictive Analysis final

Model is extremely simple as I faced multiple last minute complications within my code and did had to switch from multiple classification to the binary.

Due to performance issue as each run was taking 3 hours to run, I was limited to this output. However, the details listed in the desired model implementation we want I wish to have in results for but couldn't produce tangible numbers.
